# Crossy Roads
I chose crossy roads because in it I could apply all the things which I learned till now in one project. For this project I was facing some issues in camera setting but luckily I had time so I fix those problem. The one thing which I have not done is animation because we havenâ€™t study about animation yet. At the end I used an empty object as a win condition when the play reach that point game will stop and in console you win will be displayed. And when the player hit car object game will stop and game over will be displayed
